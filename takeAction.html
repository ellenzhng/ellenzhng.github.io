    <h2>Call Your State Legislators</h2>

		<p>
			In March 2021, Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, passed Senate Bill 6, 
			<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FSB6.pdf">SB6 - TO CREATE THE ARKANSAS UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT; TO ABOLISH ABORTION IN ARKANSAS AND PROTECT THE LIVES OF UNBORN CHILDREN; AND TO PROTECT ALL HUMAN LIFE.</a> The goal of this bill is to ban abortions completely “except to save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency”. This bill makes no exception for rape or incest and is a complete infringement on women's reproductive rights.
		</p>

		<br/>

		<p>
			Your action item today is to call your Senator to tell them that you do not support Senate Bill 6, 
			<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2021R%2FPublic%2FSB6.pdf">SB6 - TO CREATE THE ARKANSAS UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT; TO ABOLISH ABORTION IN ARKANSAS AND PROTECT THE LIVES OF UNBORN CHILDREN; AND TO PROTECT ALL HUMAN LIFE.</a>
