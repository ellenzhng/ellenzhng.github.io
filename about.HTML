    <p > Women in Arkansas are no longer able to get an abortion in cases of rape or incest. The total-ban abortion bill goes against women's constitutional right. </p>
    <p> Hi. My name is Ellen and I started this project during the Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. That year, there have been so many "abortion bans" in different states across the nation and I felt so disheartened that women in these states would not have the choice and control over what to do with their body. I was even more disheartened to see that these bans/bills were passed by male senators and governors. Therein, I made Women's Choice Arkansas to fight for reproductive rights locally in efforts to make a change as a high school student. :)</p>
